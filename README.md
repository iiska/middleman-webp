# Middleman::Webp

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/middleman-webp.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/middleman-webp)
[![Build Status](https://github.com/iiska/middleman-webp/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iiska/middleman-webp/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This is [Middleman][middleman] extension that generates WebP versions
of each image used in site during build.

WebP is image format developed by Google and it usually generates
smaller files than regular jpeg or png formats.

Browser's supporting WebP will include Accepts header to the image
file requests so you can refer to jpegs or pngs in your HTML and use
for example .htaccess configuration to provide smaller alternatives
for browser's supporting WebP.

See my blog post
["Introducing WebP extension for Middleman"][blog-post] for more
details why I think using WebP matters.

## Installation

Middleman-webp depends on cwep and gif2webp commandline tools, so
install those first for your system.

- Fedora: ```yum install libwebp-tools```
- Ubuntu: ```apt-get install webp```
- OS X: ```brew install webp --with-giflib```
- Or install from the Google's WebP site:
  https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/download

Add this line to your Middleman site's Gemfile:

    gem 'middleman-webp'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

And activate :webp extension in your config.rb:

``` ruby
activate :webp
```

### Using with old Middleman 3

You are not able to use latest gem version if you are using **Middleman 3**. In
that case install gem with following Gemfile statement:

    gem 'middleman-webp', '~> 0.3.2'
    
    
### Using with Rubies <= 2.4

Support for Rubies <= 2.4 was dropped in 1.0.0 version of this gem. If you are
unable to update Ruby version use following Gemfile statement.

    gem 'middleman-webp', '< 1.0.0'

## Options

### Custom conversion options

Options for conversion are defined using
[Ruby's glob syntax](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/Dir.html#method-c-glob)
or [Regexp](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/Regexp.html) for
matching image files and hashes containing args supported by cwebp:

``` ruby
activate :webp do |webp|
  webp.conversion_options = {
    "icons/*.png" => {lossless: true},
    "photos/**/*.jpg" => {q: 100},
    /[0-9]/.+gif$/ => {lossy: true}
  }
end
```

### Ignoring some of the image files at you site

If there are some image files that you don't want to convert to the
webp alternatives, you could ignore them using ```ignore``` option
matching those paths.

``` ruby
activate :webp do |webp|
  webp.ignore = '**/*.gif'
end
```

Ignore option accepts one or an array of String globs, Regexps or
Procs.

### Append the .webp extension instead of replacing the original extension

If you want the output images to be named **sample.png.webp**
instead of **sample.webp**, set the option `append_extension` to true.

``` ruby
activate :webp do |webp|
  webp.append_extension = true
end
```

### Forcing generation of .webp files even if they are larger

By default Middleman::WebP will only keep .webp versions if they are smaller
than original ones.

If you want avoid this behavior and always save .webp version even if they are
larger, disable allow_skip option.

``` ruby
activate :webp do |webp|
  webp.allow_skip = false
end
```

### Working with asset_hash core extension

When you use [asset_hash extension](https://middlemanapp.com/advanced/improving_cacheability/)
you may want to change whether WebP image are converted before or after
Middleman build, dependin on how you plan to serve/download them.

Default behaviour is to generate WebP images after build, which will create
identical filenames with different extension, preserving the original
asset_cache hash. This works well if you are going to replace request content
based on Accepts header while serving image files by [configuring .htaccess or something similar](#configuring-your-site-to-provide-webp-alternatives).

However if you are going to determine used file type on client side and want to
use [asset helpers](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/helper_methods/), it would
be good idea to generate WebP versions before build allowing them to have their
own asset hashes. In this case you probably want to generate WebP versions
always even if they end up to be same size or larger than originals.

``` ruby
activate :webp do |webp|
  webp.run_before_build = true
  webp.allow_skip = false
end
```

## Configuring your site to provide WebP alternatives

Configure web server to serve WebP images if they are available and
browser has set the HTTP Accept header.

Look for [this example how to do it in .htaccess][htaccess].
